# Ocents
Ocents, short for Occassions & Events, is a platform for register, schedule and manage events. 

## Use Cases 
* Create an Zoom Meeting event and invite everyone with a sharable link. 
* Got to host a paid event? Create an event and sell tickets, just by sharing a link. 
* Fundraising for a cause? Just create an event and share the link for any or all of the donations. 

[Note] This is a still a work in progress.
